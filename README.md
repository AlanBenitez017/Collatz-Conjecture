# Collatz-Conjecture
This project is a simulation of the Collatz Conjecture which is a unsolved problem in Mathematics. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term. Input ./mt-collatz followed by two numbers to run the program
